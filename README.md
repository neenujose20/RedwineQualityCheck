# Red Wine Quality Check

This project aimed to predict the quality of red wine using machine learning algorithms. The project used a red wine quality dataset from Kaggle and preprocessed the data by removing duplicates and converting the numeric quality column to categorical labels (low, medium, and high).
Three machine learning algorithms were used to predict the quality of wine â€“ classification tree, ordinal logistic regression, and neural networks. The evaluation metric used to compare the performance of the algorithms was confusion matrix. After analyzing the results, the main finding was that the classification tree algorithm performed better than the other algorithms in terms of accuracy.
Overall, the project demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms in predicting red wine quality and highlights the effectiveness of the classification tree algorithm for this particular task. The findings suggest that further research could be done to refine the classification tree algorithm and improve the accuracy of the predicting low- and high-quality wines even further.
